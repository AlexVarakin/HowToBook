# # Why are you reading this?
# 
# This book's purpose is to explain a bit about how to use Python for collecting and analyzing data. It is written specifically for students interested in sharpening their data analysis skills, by a professor who is broadly interested in cognitive science.
# 
# There is almost nothing in this book that can't be found elsewhere on the web for free. A big part of the motivation for writing the book is for the author to get practice writing, and a little book to help students get started with Python seemed like a pretty easy place to start something that would provide writing practice and potentially be useful for students too.
# 
# When you finish this book, you should be comfortable enough with Python to start tackling data analysis projects, and possibly even more. Since this book is a work in-progress, feedback is welcome: donald.varakin@gmail.com
# 
# Note that the book is not finished yet... there will eventually be six chapters.
