    "In psychology and statistics, *variables* are things that can vary. In Python, variables store values in computer memory. Although these definitions are technically different, it won't hurt us for current intents and purposes to simply go with the definition of *variable* from psychology, since that definition works with Python too, even if it's not quite technically precise. The value for a particular variable in Python can be one of many different types too. It's way beyhond the scope of this book to get into all of the different ways numbers can be represented on a computer, so I'll stick with the types that I use most often for analyzing data. Of course, it's helpful to have some variables set up first, which is very easy to do in Python.\n",

There are situations in which using an int instead of a float can cause problems, and vice versa.

(Though, with some programming styles, it doesn't always seem that way). So what happens as we assign and then change values of variables? Read the code below, and the output, to see (you can copy and paste into your own notebook if you want as well)."
