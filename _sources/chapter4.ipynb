    "# Chapter 4: User-defined Functions and Built-in Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of reusable code. If you've been following along, you may recall seeing things like print(\"stuff\") in the code blocks. These are built in functions. Python has lots of useful built in functions - you can check them out [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also very easy to create your own functions in Python. Here, we'll create a function to calculate a mean. Various Python libraries (covered in this and later chapters) have other, perhaps better methods for calculating a mean, so this function itself may not be useful beyhond a simple exercise for learning about user-defined functions in Python (which is good, because functions are indespensible). \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's easier to write your own functions than to search for the module or library that has whatever functionality you want (sometimes). But Python has some built in modules for things like ranomization, math, and statistics. Accessing them requires importing the modules, which we haven't discussed yet, but we'll go over some of the things that can these modules can do.\n",

    "## User-defined Function for The Mean\n",
    "I'm betting you know what a *mean* is: it's also commonly called an *average*. The mean is nice because it is a single number that captures the location of a set of numbers, and the mean can be precisely defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a variable x with a total of n observations, finding the mean involves first adding up all of the values of x, and then dividing the result of the summation by the number of things that were summed. That's quite a mouthful to say, but the equation expresses the idea much more succinctly. \n",

Again, that's a lot of words for something that can be so succinctly expressed using an equation.\n",

There are many other kinds of built in modules, but we'll focus on the ones for numeric and mathematical computation - and even then, just a subset of the modules. The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html) is good, and there are plenty of pretty good tutorials like [this one](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_statistics.asp). So, as usual, what's presented here isn't exhaustive, but more illusrative. I'll import the statistics module, and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation of some fake data. The general syntax for importing other built-in modules and working with their functions is the same. To import, include **import *ModuleName*** at the top of the script, and to use a function from the library save the results of *ModuleName*.*FunctionName()* to a variable, and then do whatever you want with the variable."
