    "Often, we want to perform some action only if some condition is satisfied. For example, we might want to examine only a subset of observations in a data set. In Python (and other programming languages), we can use *if*, *elif* and *else* statments in combination with comparison operators (see chapter 2) to select only the data we want to analyze. Recall, comparison operators (==,!=, >,<,>=,<=) compare the value of a variable to another value and return a boolean (true or false).\n",
    "\n",
    "*If* statements specify a condition, and what to do if that condition is true. What a program does after an *if* statement depends on what comes after. An *elif* statement will run after an *if* statment only if the condition is false, and another condition is met. An *else* statement will run if a previous *if* or *elif* statement is false, not matter what. Notice that both *elif* and *else* statements only run if the result of a previous statement is false. The difference is that *elif* statements require another condition to be true before anything happens, whereas an *else* statement does not. "
