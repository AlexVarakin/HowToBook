    "# Introduction?\n",
    "\n",
    "This book's purpose is to explain a bit about how to use Python for collecting and analyzing data. It is written specifically for students interested in sharpening their data analysis skills, by a psychology professor who is broadly interested in cognitive science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is not intended to be a standalone textbook, at least for now. This book exists in order to facilitate a seminar on data analysis in the Spring 2023 semester. There is almost nothing in this book that can't be found elsewhere on the web for free. A big part of the motivation for writing the book is for the author to get practice writing, and helping students get started with Python seemed like a pretty easy place to start something that would provide writing practice and potentially be useful for students too.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the book is finished, you should be comfortable enough with Python to start tackling data analysis projects, and possibly even more. Since this book is a work in-progress, feedback is welcome: donald.varakin@gmail.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the book is not finished yet... there will eventually be six (or seven or more) chapters."
